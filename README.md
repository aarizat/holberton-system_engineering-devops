# System engineering & DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Networking and Web stack

This repository contains the projects I developed during my time at Holberton
School. Basically, with these projects I learned about automatization of some
tasks on Linux using bash, concepts of system engineering, common commands on
Linux, networking and web infraestructure.

## Description:

The projects developed were the followings:

* [0x00. Shell, basics](./0x00-shell_basics/README.md)
* [0x01. Shell, permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions/README.md)
* [0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters](./0x02-shell_redirections/README.md)
* [0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions](./0x03-shell_variables_expansions/README.md)
* [0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing](./0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/README.md)
* [0x05. Processes and signals](./0x05-processes_and_signals/README.md)
* [0x06. Regular expression](./0x06-regular_expressions/README.md)
* [0x07. Networking basics #0](./0x07-networking_basics/README.md)
* [0x08. Networking basics #1](./0x08-networking_basics_2/README.md)
* [0x09. Web infrastructure design](./0x09-web_infrastructure_design/README.md)
